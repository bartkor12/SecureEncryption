# SecureEncryption
#### The problem
Discord is one of the most widely used messaging apps on the planet amongst gamers, yet it lacks basic privacy features which every other messaging app has: the main of which being encryption.
#### The solution
SecureEncryption aims to change this by employing a strong encryption protocol (XCHACHA20-POLY1305) to automatically encrypt your messages with a key to greatly enhance user privacy.
Now, you may be asking, "but how will my comrade be able to decipher what i'm typing?"
Great question, messages are automatically decrypted if both parties are using the same key, allowing for instant, private communication.
The extension is also toggleable, so you can easily enable and disable it whenever you want, and seamlessly integrates in with Vencord UI.
